The following design has the following problem:
● The SmartPhone interface defines methods for making calls, sending SMS,
browsing the web, and taking pictures.
● While smartphones (Iphone and Samsung) can utilize all functionalities, a
basic phone (BasicPhone) only needs calling and SMS capabilities.
● Forcing the BasicPhone class to implement unused methods (browseWeb and
takePicture) violates ISP.
